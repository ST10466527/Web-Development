Project Overview:Collection by Slindo is a simple, informational website designed to promote sustainable and affordable fashion through thrift clothing. The project introduces the concept of thrifting, showcases example second-hand products, and provides a contact form for potential buyers or sellers to get in touch. Unlike a full e-commerce site, this platform does not support online shopping or payments. Instead, it focuses on raising awareness about second-hand fashion, encouraging eco-friendly living, and presenting the brand’s mission in a clean and user-friendly way.
Website goals and objectives: Goals - The goal of the website is to promote second-hand clothing at very affordable prices especially for Teenagers who are students and young adults who still haven’t had life figured out yet. Objectives - Collection by Slindo will be a simple informational website that will introduce a thrift store concept, advertising examples of clothes, and provides a contact form for people interested in buying or selling. The website will not be an online shop, so people won’t be able to make accounts, buy, or pay for things on it. The website will advertise responsible fashion, explain the advantages of second hand clothes, and catch people’s attention with a clean design that is also easy to use.
Key Features and Functionality:	Home Page with introduction of thrift store concept. Example Products Page (static images + descriptions). Contact Form for inquiries only. About Page with mission and sustainability goals.
