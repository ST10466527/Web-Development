## Student Information  
- **Name:** Silindokuhle Makunga  
- **Student Number:** ST10466527

## Project Overview  
**Collection by Slindo** is a simple informational website designed to promote sustainable and affordable fashion through thrift clothing.  

The project introduces the concept of thrifting, showcases example second-hand products, and provides a contact form for potential buyers or sellers to get in touch.  

Unlike a full e-commerce site, this platform does not support online shopping or payments. Instead, it focuses on:  
- Raising awareness about second-hand fashion.  
- Encouraging eco-friendly living.  
- Presenting the brand’s mission in a clean and user-friendly way.
